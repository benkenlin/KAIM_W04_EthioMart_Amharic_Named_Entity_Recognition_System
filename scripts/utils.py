# scripts/utils.py
# Add any project-wide utility functions here as they become necessary.
# For instance, if you have a very specific Amharic tokenization or cleaning routine
# that several scripts would use, it could go here.

# Example placeholder:
# import re
# def custom_amharic_tokenizer(text):
#     # Implement your custom Amharic tokenization logic
#     pass

# def clean_numeric_values(text):
#     # Implement cleaning for numbers, currency symbols, etc.
#     pass
