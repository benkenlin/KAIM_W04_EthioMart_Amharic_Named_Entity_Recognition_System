# KAIM_W04_EthioMart_Amharic_Named_Entity_Recognition_System
The project aims to develop an Amharic NER (Named Entity Recognition) system to extract vital business entities (Product, Price, Location) from diverse Telegram channel content. This extracted, structured data will feed into EthioMart's centralized database, facilitating a seamless e-commerce experience for customers and vendors.
